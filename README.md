# rest-api-python-flask-online-marketplace

I created this REST API for an online marketplace with multiple stores, each store's items and prices.

It lets you add, retrieve, change, and delete store names, item names, and prices.

I built this project using Python, flask, Flask-RESTful, and JWT, all the while closely (but not verbatim) following Jose Salvatierra's Udemy course:Â https://github.com/tecladocode/rest-api-sections.
